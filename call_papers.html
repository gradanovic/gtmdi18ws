						<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
					</header>
					
					<p class="align-left"> 
					All submitted contributions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of submission, 
					originality, and breath of interest. We especially welcome contributions on emerging topics that have the potential 
					to encourage discussions. Industrial applications and position papers that present novel ideas, issues, challenges and 
					directions are also welcome. Specifically we solicit the following two types of submissions: 
					</p>
					<ol class="align-left">
						<li>Research papers that report the results of new, recent, or ongoing research, emphasizing either on 
							theory side or application side or both. </li>
						<li>Challenge/Position papers describe a vision for how data elicitation for AI systems should evolve as a field.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="align-left">
					To foster and encourage a wide participation and discussion, there will be no formal workshop proceedings. 
					All accepted papers (posters, abstract, preliminary draft as authors prefer) will be posted on our website to 
					the benefit of the participants to the workshop. Submissions of preliminary work and papers to be submitted or in 
					preparation for submission to other major venues in the field are encouraged. Papers that appeared on arXiv, but 
					havenâ€™t been accepted for publication, are encouraged. 
					</p>
